# Algorithmic Armory: A Portfolio of Tested Solutions

This repository is not merely a collection of solved coding problems. It is a curated armory of battle-ready algorithmic weapons, each one forged, tested, and polished to the highest standard of quality and efficiency.

## Philosophy: The Untested Blade is a Flawed Blade

In the world of software engineering, a solution that is not robustly tested is a liability. The core philosophy of this repository is that the *process* of arriving at a solution is as important as the solution itself.

Every algorithm contained herein is accompanied by a comprehensive test suite built with the **pytest** framework. This commitment to testing demonstrates:

* **Discipline:** A methodical approach to problem-solving.
* **Quality:** An understanding of edge cases and a commitment to writing reliable, production-ready code.
* **Best Practices:** A practical application of Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

This is a log of not just what I can solve, but of the engineering rigor I bring to every challenge.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is organized into its own self-contained directory for clarity and modularity. The protocol is as follows:

└── Problem_Name/
├── solution.py   # Contains the solution class and method
└── test_solution.py  # Contains the pytest test cases


## Running the Tests

To verify the integrity of any solution, navigate to the root directory of the repository and execute the test suite.

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```shell
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  **Run all tests:**
    ```shell
    pytest
    ```
